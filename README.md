Arctic is a high performance datastore for numeric data. It supports [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays and pickled objects out-of-the-box, with pluggable support for
other data types and optional versioning.

Arctic can query millions of rows per second per client, achieves ~10x compression on network bandwidth,
~10x compression on disk, and scales to hundreds of millions of rows per second per
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) instance.

Arctic has been under active development at [Man Group](https://www.man.com/) since 2012.

## Man Group is currently building the next generation of Arctic.

This will offer the same intuitive Python-centric API whilst utilizing a custom C++ storage engine and modern S3 compatible object storage to provide a timeseries database that is:

* **Fast**: Capable of processing billions of rows in seconds
* **Flexible**: Designed to handle complex real-world datasets
* **Familiar**: Built for the modern Python Data Science ecosystem - Pandas In/Pandas Out!

For more information, please contact us at [arctic@man.com](arctic@man.com).

## Quickstart

### Install Arctic

``
pip install git+https://github.com/spyamine/arctic-amine.git
``

### Run a MongoDB

``
mongod --dbpath <path/to/db_directory>
``

## Using VersionStore
``
from arctic import Arctic
import quandl
``
### Connect to Local MONGODB
``
store = Arctic('localhost')
``

### Create the library - defaults to VersionStore
``
store.initialize_library('NASDAQ')
``

### Access the library
``
library = store['NASDAQ']
``

### Load some data - maybe from Quandl
``
aapl = quandl.get("WIKI/AAPL", authtoken="your token here")
``

### Store the data in the library
``
library.write('AAPL', aapl, metadata={'source': 'Quandl'})
``

### Reading the data
``
item = library.read('AAPL')
aapl = item.data
metadata = item.metadata
``

VersionStore supports much more: [See the HowTo](howtos/how_to_use_arctic.py)!


### Adding your own storage engine

Plugging a custom class in as a library type is straightforward. [This example
shows how.](howtos/how_to_custom_arctic_library.py)

## Documentation

You can find complete documentation at [Arctic docs](https://arctic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Concepts

### Libraries

Arctic provides namespaced *libraries* of data.  These libraries allow
bucketing data by *source*, *user* or some other metric (for example frequency:
End-Of-Day; Minute Bars; etc.).

Arctic supports multiple data libraries per user.  A user (or namespace)
maps to a MongoDB database (the granularity of mongo authentication).  The library
itself is composed of a number of collections within the database. Libraries look like:

  * user.EOD
  * user.ONEMINUTE

A library is mapped to a Python class.  All library databases in MongoDB are prefixed with 'arctic\_'

### Storage Engines

Arctic includes three storage engines:

  * [VersionStore](arctic/store/version_store.py): a key-value versioned TimeSeries store. It supports:
      * Pandas data types (other Python types pickled)
      * Multiple versions of each data item. Can easily read previous versions.
      * Create point-in-time snapshots across symbols in a library
      * Soft quota support
      * Hooks for persisting other data types
      * Audited writes: API for saving metadata and data before and after a write.
      * a wide range of TimeSeries data frequencies: End-Of-Day to Minute bars
      * [See the HowTo](howtos/how_to_use_arctic.py)
      * [Documentation](docs/versionstore.md)
  * [TickStore](arctic/tickstore/tickstore.py): Column oriented tick database.  Supports
    dynamic fields, chunks aren't versioned. Designed for large continuously ticking data.
  * [Chunkstore](https://github.com/man-group/arctic/wiki/Chunkstore): A storage type that allows data to be stored in customizable chunk sizes. Chunks
    aren't versioned, and can be appended to and updated in place. 
    * [Documentation](docs/chunkstore.md)

Arctic storage implementations are **pluggable**.  VersionStore is the default.
